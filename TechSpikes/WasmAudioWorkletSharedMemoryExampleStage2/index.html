    <h1>AudioWorklet + WASM in Shared Memory + coi-serviceworker</h1>
    
    <p>Sound generation on AudioWorklet (2nd javascript "thread" instance).</p>
	
	<p>Running of WASM program on the AudioWorklet (as the emulator would be).</p>
	
	<p>Hosting the WASM memory in a SharedArrayBuffer, which has ramifications 
	on the C program's linker, since a SHARED flag exists in the WASM executable 
	to consent to the WASM memory being held in a JS SharedArrayBuffer.</p>
	
	<p>Accessing the WASM memory via a Float32Array alias over the SharedArrayBuffer. 
	This is a model for bi-directional data access, and would be used for the 
	emulator keyboard/screen.</p>
