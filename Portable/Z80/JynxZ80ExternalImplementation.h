// Z80ImplementationBaseClass
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
// The Z80 needs to call user-defined functions to perform regular 
// address-space READ / WRITE, and I/O space reads and writes ("IN" / "OUT").
//
//    ** The user must supply these functions **
//
// The most obvious(!) design solution is to have a Z80 base class with 
// pure virtual functions for the above.  The user derives his own class and
// implements the functions.
//
// However, it may be desireable to have choice over the performance 
// of the function call dispatch.
//
// C++ has two function call dispatch mechanisms:
//   - Statically dispatched call   : The function to be called is identified at compile-time.
//   - Dynamically dispatched call  : The function to be called is determined at run-time.  A "virtual" function call.
//
// Further to the above -
//
// Statically-dispatched calls may be implemented with:
//    - inlining     (no stack frame building overhead)
//    - non-inline   (a stack frame is built to perform the call)
//
// Statically-dispatched calls may also choose:
//    - to implement the singleton pattern:  The function has no "this" pointer operand (C++ "static" keyword).
//    - to be a "member" function:           The function is passed the address of an object as the "this" pointer operand.
//
// I wanted to have a way of allowing a user to decide.
//
// This is a bit grubby, but basically the strategy is:  ** The user provides the BASE CLASS **.
// You do this by changing this file only.
//

/*

// Example for inlining:
// (Your implementation of these functions may need to up-cast to "class Z80", unfortunately).

class Z80ImplementationBaseClass

	inline void GuestWrite(  uint16_t address, uint8_t value );
	inline void GuestWriteIOSpace( uint16_t portNumber, uint8_t value );
	inline uint8_t GuestRead( uint16_t address );
	inline uint8_t GuestReadIOSpace( uint16_t port );
};

// (Your implementation of these functions may need to up-cast to "class Z80", unfortunately).

class Z80ImplementationBaseClass
{
protected:
	void GuestWrite(  uint16_t address, uint8_t value );
	void GuestWriteIOSpace( uint16_t portNumber, uint8_t value );
	uint8_t GuestRead( uint16_t address );
	uint8_t GuestReadIOSpace( uint16_t port );
};

// Example for singleton pattern

	static void GuestWrite(  uint16_t address, uint8_t value );
	static void GuestWriteIOSpace( uint16_t portNumber, uint8_t value );
	static uint8_t GuestRead( uint16_t address );
	static uint8_t GuestReadIOSpace( uint16_t port );
};

// Example for pure virtual functions.
// Then you derive from "class Z80", and implement these.
// You can then have as many Z80 instances as you want.
// And as many emulator types as you want!

	virtual void GuestWrite(  uint16_t address, uint8_t value ) = 0;

	virtual uint8_t GuestRead( uint16_t address ) = 0;
	virtual uint8_t GuestReadIOSpace( uint16_t port ) = 0;
