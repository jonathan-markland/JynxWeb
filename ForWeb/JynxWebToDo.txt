JYNX WEB
--------

Phase I

	[ ] Push these new repos to GitHub.

	[X] C# Tests for the never-freeing memory allocator
	[X] Jynx Panic moved to its own header file outside the framework.
	[X] Translate never-freeing memory allocator to C++
	[ ] We need to see that we can cause the compiler-generated initialisers for global objects to run.
	[X] Spike compiling and usage of JynxFramework
	[ ] Spike JynxFramework "operator new" / "placement new".
	[ ] Investigate requesting the browser to repaint a rectangular portion of the guest display. -- idealism; not 100% essential right away.
	[ ] Have a defined Device Layer : LynxHardware folder
		- Screen handler:    Compose RGBA pixels in static buffer on write to Lynx screen. Invalid Band flags.  [MVP == No 6845]
		- Keyboard handler:  State machine maintaining flags:  Host Key up / Key down sets bits in static buffer.
		- Sound handler:     Every speaker write get the level 0-63 and Z80 count.  Write sound static buffer.
		- extern "C" api to get addresses of static buffers.
		- De-couple from UI and higher-level features.
		- What support does the TAPE need?  Tape motor on and off.  How to split that between LynxHardware and higher-level?  
		  Design this now.
	[ ] Convert some tape images to C binary for static-linking.

Phase II

	[ ] Build Jynx by linking one tape image, and automate the Lynx to run at boot up.  [MVP == no BASIC because BASIC needs menus + file up/download]
	[ ] Proper heap allocator needed -- spike in the CsHeapManagerPrototype project.

	[X] Spike test the AutoWorkLet (128 samples at a time). -- C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\Work\webaudio-examples\audioworklet
	[X] Spike test the bare metal WASM
	[X] Spike test data transfer to/from WASM memory space.
	[X] Spike test image in WASM space
	[X] Create proper folder for the web based emulator C++ code.
	
	
Strategy for JynxFramework
--------------------------
	
	[ ] The JynxFramework main repo line is currently the (separate) Work/JynxFramework folder
	[ ] I am getting random stuff to compile against the new JynxFramework in the old Jynx folder (on a branch),
	    but Work/Jynx/Portable/ is NOT THE PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT LOCATION for the framework!


Strategy for WEB
----------------

No LibC.  Use JynxFramework instead, plus a possibly custom allocator.

When the audio handler is called

	- Do 128 samples worth of Z80 time  (11610 cycles @ 44,100Hz sample rate)
	- Check WASM's screen flags for need to queue a JS function to update screen.
	- Return the audio
	
Keyboard event (JS)

	- Maintain key flags in WASM memory space, on keyup/down.
	- No other actions required

Screen

	- Audio handler queues 'permission' to check.



WASM only (no emscripten)
=========================

	- Need Heap manager LibC
	- JynxFramework

			Experimental: This is an experimental technology
			Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.

			The global crossOriginIsolated read-only property returns a boolean value that indicates whether a SharedArrayBuffer can be sent via a Window.postMessage() call.
