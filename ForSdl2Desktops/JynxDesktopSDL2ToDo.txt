JYNX DESKTOP SDL2
=================

	[X] Spike test SDL2 generation of wave audio (on the Desktop).



Strategy for Desktop
--------------------

	- Rip out multi-threading and frameworks.
	- Use SDL2 on Windows and Linux
	- Make the desktop version mimic the browser so that:
		- the code is all on one thread
		- the Portable (shared) library has no threads knowledge or 
		  file system knowledge or anything else non-browser
